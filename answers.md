1) What was the important theme for this chapter?
The main purpose of programming is to make a user-friendly system which is easy to use for everyone. The system must have a conceptual integrity which can be achieved by separating architecture from implementation. The architect team must have an idea about how the system will be at the end that everyone else in the whole building can unserstand. 

2) How does this chapter tie in what you know about development in this stage in your career?
I guess when trying to create the best project as a team, achieving conceptual integrity is the hardest part as each member tends to stick with his own idea. Implementors sometimes are not happy because they MUST follow with architects' ideas after they all come up with a conceptual integrity.

3) What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?
I always think a good (cool) app is one which a lot of features but I'm wrong until I read this chapter. A good app is the one that is easy to use and just has NEEDED features because users won't have time to learn how to use all the EXTRA features.

4) Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today? Why or Why not?
It is definitely still applicable to development today because pretty much  all softwares, apps and webpages are now created by a team and in order to deliver the best product for users, everyone in team must be on the same page.

5) Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?
I'm really surprised that when working as a team in software development, a novel idea by an individual will NOT be accepted if it does not fit the overall project design.

6) How awesome is this book?!!?
I haven't read all the book. With only 2 chapters that I read, I think this is an awesome book which helps me understand how the job is done in the real world where I will have to work with many other developers in order to build a project together.
