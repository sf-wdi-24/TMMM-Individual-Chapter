1. The main theme of this chapter was the size a program takes and the cost associated with it. There has to be trade-offs between size and speed when setting size targets where one way to do this is trade function for size.
2. Although I've always knew the importance of speed this chapter, along with the course has really emphasized that speed is a astronomical factor when writing your code. The difference between seconds can cause great impact on user experience and you have to refactor your code accordingly. Learning about big-o notation and functions has really taught me the importance and impact speed has.
3. Honestly this chapter has taught me that I know nothing about programming. Literally nothing. It is quite scary.
4. Absolutely. Speed of your program has a drastic impact on the overall quality of your work and must no be taken for granted.
5. To touch on the answer I had for question 3, there are many revelations. I have no thought of the speed of the code I write nor the impact it may have. I should become more aware of the operations that may take up more time than others to get a better grasp on how speed and programming partake on the user's experience.
6. This book is great. It really makes me think in ways I would have  never thought and makes me wonder about questions I would have never knew to ask. I think this is a great read and will continue to read the rest of this book.
