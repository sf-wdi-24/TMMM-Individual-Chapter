1. I think the theme of this chapter was about bugs and different ways to debug or completly design bugs out.

2. In general i think in a early stage of a developers career they deal with tons and tons of bugs everyday, I believe this chapter can give you some tip on bugs

3. The most important lesson i learn was the definition of bug-proofing which is 'The most perniciuos and suble bugs are system bugs arising from mismatched assumptions made by the authors of various components'.

4. yes i feel like this chapter is applicable to development today, because i doubt there is bugless code anywhere.

5. I dont think so, I know what bugs are however Ive found new ways to tackle them.
