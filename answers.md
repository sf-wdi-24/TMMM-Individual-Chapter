###What was the important theme for this chapter?

- The overall theme in this chapter is about communicating and being organized.  The level of organization is proportionate to how communicative the team is.  The biggest takeaway is that a ‘workbook’ needs to be created and constantly updated throughout the project.  This workbook will include everything from project objectives, internal/external specifications, technical standards and administrative memos.  The concept of a workbook means that all employees should have access to all the information of a project, whether or not they need that information.  A developers decision to change an output or use more resources can drastically affect something further along on the project.
- The other theme for this chapter is that the structure of a team should be divided so that a single manager is not doing the work of a technical director and a producer.  The producer is a manager in the traditional sense and a tech director is more in charge of the direction of the product.  These two positions need to be on the same level, where one doesn’t need to report the other when dealing with problems.  This can be the same person on very small teams but really should be done by two different people.


###How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?

- This chapter reinforces the idea of communication and organization.  The organization I can relate to taking time to plan projects out from the beginning and really have an understanding of what I want it to do/look like before diving in.  The idea of communication just reinforces the idea that when working in a team you need to make sure that everyone is on the same page.  This can be accomplished by having a ‘workbook’ , informal chat sessions or routine meetings where the project is discussed.  These meetings can remove any grey areas in the project.

###What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?
- Basically what I wrote for the last question.  The importance of communicating often and thoroughly with a team is something that cannot be skipped or half assed. 
	
###Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today? Why or Why not?
- There are still applicable lessons in this chapter.  Everything written about organizing and communicating projects can still be applied today.  I’m not sure how relevant Microfiche is in the industry but maybe I’ll be in for a surprise when my project workbook comes in that form.  Also, the availability of a “computer-driven text editing system” for creating workbooks might be easier to come by than it was back in 1972.

###Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?
- I was surprised at how much of this seemed relevant over 40 years after this book was written.  The computer systems and programs that were being talked about are light years behind that computers now can accomplish but the lessons are still just as necessary.

###How awesome is this book?!!?
- After reading 2/15 of this book I am very intrigued as to how many lessons can still be learned from a book written 13 years before I was born about managing programming projects.  I will most likely read the whole thing over the break.
