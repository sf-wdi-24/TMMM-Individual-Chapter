1. What was the important theme for this chapter?
	The theme touched on best practices for creating well documented and readable programs.

2. How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?
	Documentation is one of the most important aspects of programming because it, as the text says, allows the program to speak to the human. Without clear documentation, most programs would be obsolete because most would have no idea of how to implement them properly. Even in some cases, the creator. (Considering they forgot the content of their own work.)

3. What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?
	There are best practices to documenting our work and we must do so.

4. Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today? Why or Why not?
	Absolutely. I think it would be hard to create and sell anyone on a program that only you as the creator can properly use. If you're the only person who can gain use from a program made for many, then what is the point?

5. Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?
	That even documenting your own work as a programmmer can be as challenging as programming itself. Knowing how to skillfully convey the usefullness of your program is an art within itself. Practice, practice, and practice.

6. How awesome is this book?!!?
	Pretty darn awesome! You can sense how passionate the author is about his craft and how wise he has become trying to perfect it and yet is self aware and humble. I find it hard to not get excited about something so skillfully written about. 
		The anecdotes and lessons here also lend a lot to a novel understanding of how our journeys as developers will progress and eventually evolve to become. I look forward to reading the rest.
