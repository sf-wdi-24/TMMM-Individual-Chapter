## The Second-System Effect

**1.  What was the important theme for this chapter?**

The overarching theme for this chapter is that developers often aim for too many features during the second iteration of a project.

**2.  How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?**

This chapter ties in to what we have been learning while gearing up for our first project.  While we are not doing the second iteration of the project yet, it is still important for us to remember to scale back our ideas and come up with a minimum viable product first.

**3. What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?**

I wouldn't say that I learned an important lesson from this chapter.  It certainly enlightened me to the idea that I need to be careful with the second iteration of any projects I do.  I think that to truly learn this though, I will need to experience it.

**4. Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today?  Why or Why not?**

I do think that this chapter is still relevant.  I'm certain that this will continue to be applicable as long as developers are developing.

**5. Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?**

The biggest revelation that I had was that the second iteration is tougher than the first.  I assumed that people would generally be too ambitious on their initial project, not on the second specifically.

**6. How awesome is this book?!!?**

The ideas in this book are great.  I did think that the chapter was a little hard to follow in parts because the technology that was referenced was so old that even I had not heard of it.
