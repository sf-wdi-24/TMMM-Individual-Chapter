What was the important theme for this chapter?
Interactive programming instead of batching is more efficient, as it provides more effective tools for development and debugging.

How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?
even in the simplest project, team work is more efficient than going solo. In class projects, team effor triggers some ideas other's may not even think of. Likewise, implementing precise tools makes the work flow faster. As we have experienced, we have a diverse tool box of libraries and languages, each more and more specialized in order to serve the purpose of making a more effective final product.

What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?
team effort at all stages makes it for a better, faster and more efficient product.

Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today? Why or Why not?
Yes. machines might be exponentially faster, but they are still software machines. In software development, the implementation of the right tools is still critical, even more so as the number of users has also increased exponentially since then.


Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?
How awesome is this book?!!?
The levels of specialization can not isolate the members; on the contrary, the more specialization there is, the greater the need to wove an effective teamwork flow in order to deliver an effecive product.
This book rocks! Heck yeah!
