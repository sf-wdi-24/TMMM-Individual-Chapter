1. What was the important theme for this chapter?

The surgical team- this chapter is about the dilemma between using a few quick minds vs a larger team of less skilled programmers.

2. How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?

It's more effective if we as developers work together to support each other, than it is to all attack the same problem separately.

3. What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?

Harlan Mills' proposal was that each segment of a large team should be handled by a programming team of 10 people, who are organized like a surgical team. One member cuts away at a problem, and the others give them support that will help with effectiveness and productivity.

This approach could also be scaled up for bigger teams, with the concept that team members are deferring to the surgeon and co-pilot for direction, so there are no judgement differences.

4. Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today? Why or Why not?

Definitely. I think the fewer people that have to coordinate, the more efficient a project will be, without having so few people working on the project that it won't meet the deadline.

5. Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?

Yes, this is an interesting approach I was not aware of before. It sounds like an efficient strategy.

6. How awesome is this book?!!?

Pretty awesome! It already feels like it's the holy grail of programming.
